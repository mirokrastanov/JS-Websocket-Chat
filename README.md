# JS-Websocket-Chat
Real time chat room using websockets for communication.

## Readme in progress...
- Until the project is completed you can observe the current progress log below.


### In progress log:
1. Created a server using a library called [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws)
2. Made a script to run the server
3. Created a client using vanilla JS and a few basic elements
    - A form to take user's input
    - An unordered list to display messages into as they come through
4. Made sure messages are also readable on the server - reading from the buffer
5. ...

### TODO List: 
1. Replace client code with a more sophisticated UI - possibly using a frond end framework
2. Level up the server so that it can support real time updates, multiple clients, multiple chat rooms, etc.
3. Deploy
